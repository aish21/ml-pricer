EDA findings:
Total samples: 500000
Class distribution (option types):
 asian: 140000
 call: 130000
 put: 130000
 digital: 100000
Suggested preprocessing for trees:
 - Keep raw features; tree models do not require scaling.
 - Encode option_flag as categorical integer or one-hot depending on model (GBM supports categorical directly).
 - Consider clipping NN predictions to be >=0 or training with non-negative targets if using regression models.
 - Digitals have many near-0 labels; consider oversampling digitals or using separate models for discrete payoffs.
 - Feature importance from LightGBM shows which prefix/time features matter; use those for feature selection. (see lgbm_feature_importance.png)
